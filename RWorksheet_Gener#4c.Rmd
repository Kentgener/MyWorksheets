## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

• Download and open the mpg file. Upload it to your OWN environment
a. Show your solutions on how to import a csv file into the environment.
```{r}
mpg_data <- read.csv('mpg.csv')
```

b. Which variables from mpg dataset are categorical?
```{r}
str(mpg_data)

categorical_vars <- c("manufacturer", "model", "year", "cyl", "trans", "drv", "fl", "class")
cat("Categorical variables:", categorical_vars, "\n")
```

c. Which are continuous variables?
```{r}
str(mpg_data)
continuous_vars <- c("displ", "cty", "hwy")
cat("Continuous variables:", continuous_vars, "\n")
```

2. Which manufacturer has the most models in this data set? Which model has the most variations?
Show your answer.
```{r}
library(dplyr)

models_per_manufacturer <- mpg_data %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(unique_models = n_distinct(model))

models_per_manufacturer

```

a. Group the manufacturers and find the unique models. Show your codes and result.
```{r}
library(dplyr)

models_per_manufacturer <- mpg_data %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(unique_models = n_distinct(model))

models_per_manufacturer

```

b. Graph the result by using plot() and ggplot(). Write the codes and its result.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(models_per_manufacturer, aes(x = manufacturer, y = unique_models)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "Number of Unique Models per Manufacturer", x = "Manufacturer", y = "Number of Unique Models") +
  theme_minimal()

```

2. Same dataset will be used. You are going to show the relationship of the modeland the manufacturer.

a. What does ggplot(mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point() show?
```{r}
ggplot(mpg_data, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point()
```

b. For you, is it useful? If not, how could you modify the data to make it more informative?
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

model_manufacturer_count <- mpg %>%
  group_by(model, manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

ggplot(model_manufacturer_count, aes(x = model, fill = manufacturer)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Number of Models per Manufacturer",
       x = "Model", y = "Count",
       fill = "Manufacturer") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

3. Plot the model and the year using ggplot(). Use only the top 20 observations. Write the codes and
its results.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Relationship between Engine Displacement and Highway MPG",
       x = "Engine Displacement", y = "Highway MPG",
       color = "Number of Cylinders") +
  scale_color_continuous(name = "Number of Cylinders") +
  theme_minimal()

```

4. Using the pipe (%>%), group the model and get the number of cars per model. Show codes and its result
```{r}
library(dplyr)

cars_per_model <- mpg %>%
  group_by(model) %>%
  summarise(num_cars = n())

cars_per_model

```

a. Plot using geom_bar() using the top 20 observations only. The graphs shoudl have a title, labels and
colors. Show code and results.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

all_models <- unique(mpg$model)

ggplot(mpg %>% filter(model %in% all_models[1:20]), aes(x = model)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Number of Cars per Model (Top 20 Observations)",
       x = "Model", y = "Number of Cars") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

b. Plot using the geom_bar() + coord_flip() just like what is shown below. Show codes and its result.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(cars_per_model, aes(x = model, y = num_cars)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue", color = "black", stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Number of Cars per Model",
       x = "Model", y = "Number of Cars") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal()

```

5. Plot the relationship between cyl - number of cylinders and displ - engine displacement using
geom_point with aesthetic color = engine displacement. Title should be “Relationship between
No. of Cylinders and Engine Displacement”.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cyl, y = displ, color = displ)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Relationship between No. of Cylinders and Engine Displacement",
       x = "Number of Cylinders", y = "Engine Displacement") +
  scale_color_continuous(name = "Engine Displacement") +
  theme_minimal()

```

a. How would you describe its relationship? Show the codes and its result.
```{r}
#The relationship between cylinder count and engine displacement is often #positive, with larger engines having more cylinders. This trend is #common in automotive engineering. The color gradient helps visualize #engine displacement varying across points in the plot. Clusters of #points may indicate more common combinations of cylinder count and #displacement. The color scale provides additional information about #engine displacement for each point. Identifying specific patterns or #clusters in the plot can be described based on the distribution of #points in different regions.
```

6. Plot the relationship between displ (engine displacement) and hwy(highway miles per gallon). Mapped
it with a continuous variable you have identified in #1-c. What is its result? Why it produced such
output?

6. Import the traffic.csv onto your R environment.
```{r}
traffic <- read.csv("traffic.csv")

head(traffic)

```

a. How many numbers of observation does it have? What are the variables of the traffic dataset the Show
your answer.
```{r}
num_observations <- nrow(traffic)

variables <- names(traffic)

cat("Number of Observations:", num_observations, "\n")
cat("Variables:", paste(variables, collapse = ", "), "\n")

```

b. subset the traffic dataset into junctions. What is the R codes and its output?
```{r}
junctions <- unique(traffic$junction)

junctions

```

c. Plot each junction in a using geom_line(). Show your solution and output.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(traffic, aes(x = DateTime, y = Vehicles, color = Junction)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Traffic Volume Over Time for Each Junction",
       x = "Timestamp", y = "Traffic Volume",
       color = "Junction") +
  theme_minimal()

```

7. From alexa_file.xlsx, import it to your environment
```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("readxl", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("readxl")
}
library(readxl)

file_path <- "alexa_file.xlsx"

alexa_data <- read_excel(file_path)

head(alexa_data)

```
a. How many observations does alexa_file has? What about the number of columns? Show your solution
and answer.
```{r}
num_observations <- nrow(alexa_data)

num_columns <- ncol(alexa_data)

cat("Number of Observations:", num_observations, "\n")
cat("Number of Columns:", num_columns, "\n")

```

b. group the variations and get the total of each variations. Use dplyr package. Show solution and
answer.
```{r}
library(dplyr)

variation_totals <- alexa_data %>%
  group_by(variation) %>%
  summarise(total = n())

variation_totals

```

c. Plot the variations using the ggplot() function. What did you observe? Complete the details of the
graph. Show solution and answer.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(alexa_data, aes(x = variation)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Alexa Variations",
       x = "Variation",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

```
