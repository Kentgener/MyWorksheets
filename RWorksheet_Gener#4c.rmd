## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

1. Use the dataset mpg

A data frame with 234 rows and 11 variables:
#’ \describe{
#’ \item{manufacturer}{manufacturer name}
#’ \item{model}{model name}
#’ \item{displ}{engine displacement, in litres}
#’ \item{year}{year of manufacture}
#’ \item{cyl}{number of cylinders}
#’ \item{trans}{type of transmission}
#’ \item{drv}{the type of drive train, where f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd}
#’ \item{cty}{city miles per gallon}
#’ \item{hwy}{highway miles per gallon}
#’ \item{fl}{fuel type}
#’ \item{class}{"type" of car}
#’ }
"mpg"
• Download and open the mpg file. Upload it to your OWN environment
a. Show your solutions on how to import a csv file into the environment.
```{r}
# If the file is in the same directory as your R script
df <- read.csv('mpg.csv')

# If the file is in a different directory
df <- read.csv('mpg.csv')
```

b. Which variables from mpg dataset are categorical?
```{r}

```

c. Which are continuous variables?
```{r}

```
