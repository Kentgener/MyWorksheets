## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Using Loop Function
for() loop
1. Using the for loop, create an R script that will display a 5x5 matrix as shown in
Figure 1. It must contain vectorA = [1,2,3,4,5] and a 5 x 5 zero matrix.
Hint Use abs() function to get the absolute value
```{r}
vectorA <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

matrixA <- matrix(0, nrow = 5, ncol = 5)

for (i in 1:5) {
  for (j in 1:5) {
    matrixA[i, j] <- abs(vectorA[i] - vectorA[j])
  }
}

print(matrixA)

```
2. Print the string "*" using for() function. The output should be the same as shown
in Figure
```{r}
num_rows <- 5

for (i in 1:num_rows) {
  for (j in 1:i) {
    cat("* ", sep = "")
  }
  cat("\n")
}

```

3. Get an input from the user to print the Fibonacci sequence starting from the 1st input
up to 500. Use repeat and break statements. Write the R Scripts and its output.
```{r}
fibonacci <- function(n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return(n)
  } else {
    return(fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2))
  }
}

user_input <- as.numeric(readline(prompt = "Enter the number of terms for Fibonacci sequence: "))

current_term <- 1
fibonacci_value <- 0

repeat {
  fibonacci_value <- fibonacci(current_term)
  
  if (fibonacci_value > 500) {
    break 
  }
  
  cat(fibonacci_value, " ")

  current_term <- current_term + 1
}

```
Using Basic Graphics (plot(),barplot(),pie(),hist())
4. Import the dataset as shown in Figure 1 you have created previously.

```{r}
figure1matrix <- read.csv("Figure1Matrix.csv")
```
a. What is the R script for importing an excel or a csv file? Display the first 6 rows of
the dataset? Show your codes and its result
```{r}
Shoe_Size <- read.csv("ShoeSize.csv")

head(Shoe_Size, 6)
```

b. Create a subset for gender(female and male). How many observations are there in
Male? How about in Female? Write the R scripts and its output.
```{R}
female_subset <- subset(Shoe_Size, Gender == "F")

male_subset <- subset(Shoe_Size, Gender == "M")

nrow(female_subset)

nrow(male_subset)
```

c. Create a graph for the number of males and females for Household Data. Use plot(),
chart type = barplot. Make sure to place title, legends, and colors. Write the R scripts and
its result.
```{r}
freq_table <- table(Shoe_Size$Gender)

colors <- c("lightblue", "lightgreen")

barplot(freq_table, 
        main = "Number of Shoe Sizes in Household Data",
        xlab = "Shoe Size",
        ylab = "Frequency",
        col = colors,
        border = "black",
        legend = rownames(freq_table),
        horiz = TRUE)
```

5. The monthly income of Dela Cruz family was spent on the following:
Food Electricity Savings Miscellaneous
60 10 5 25
a. Create a piechart that will include labels in percentage.Add some colors and title of
the chart. Write the R scripts and show its output.
```{r}

dela_cruz <- data.frame(category = c("Food", "Electricity", "Savings", "Miscellaneous"),
                 value = c(60, 10, 5, 25))

pie(dela_cruz$value, labels = dela_cruz$category, col = rainbow(nrow(dela_cruz)), main = "Dela Cruz Family Expenses")
legend("topright", inset = c(-0.2, 0), legend = dela_cruz$category, fill = rainbow(nrow(dela_cruz)), title = "Expenses")
```

6. Use the iris dataset.
```{r}
data(iris)
```
a. Check for the structure of the dataset using the str() function. Describe what you
have seen in the output.
```{r}
 str(iris)
```

b. Create an R object that will contain the mean of the sepal.length,
sepal.width,petal.length,and petal.width. What is the R script and its result?
```{r}
means <- aggregate(iris[, 1:4], by=list(Species=iris$Species), FUN=mean)

means
```

c. Create a pie chart for the Species distribution. Add title, legends, and colors. Write
the R script and its result.
```{r}
pie_chart <- pie(table(iris$Species), col=rainbow(3), main="Species Distribution in Iris Dataset")

legend("topright", inset=c(-0.15, 0), legend=levels(iris$Species), fill=rainbow(3), title="Species")
```

d. Subset the species into setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Write the R scripts
and show the last six (6) rows of each species.
```{r}
setosa <- subset(iris, Species == "setosa")
versicolor <- subset(iris, Species == "versicolor")
virginica <- subset(iris, Species == "virginica")

species <- c(setosa,versicolor,virginica)
```

e. Create a scatterplot of the sepal.length and sepal.width using the different
species(setosa,versicolor,virginica). Add a title = “Iris Dataset”, subtitle = “Sepal
width and length, labels for the x and y axis, the pch symbol and colors should be based on
the species.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
 geom_point(size = 3, shape = 21, stroke = 2) +
 scale_color_manual(values = c("setosa" = "blue", "versicolor" = "red", "virginica" = "green")) +
 labs(title = "Iris Dataset", subtitle = "Sepal width and length",
       x = "Sepal Length", y = "Sepal Width")
```

Hint: Need to convert to factors the species to store categorical variables.
```{r}
species_factors <- factor(iris$Species)
```

f. Interpret the result.
```{r}
#You can now use the species_factors variable in your model instead of the original species variable. This is because the factor variable provides a more compact representation of the categorical data, which can be useful for statistical analyses
```
