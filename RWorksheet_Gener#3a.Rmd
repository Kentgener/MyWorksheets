## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Task 1
#Using Vectors
#1. There is a built-in vector LETTERS contains the #uppercase letters of the alphabet
#and letters which contains the lowercase letters of #the alphabet.

#LETTERS
## [1] "A" "B" "C" "D" "E" "F" "G" "H" "I" "J" "K" "L" "M" "N" "O" "P" "Q" "R" "S"
## [20] "T" "U" "V" "W" "X" "Y" "Z"

letters
## [1] "a" "b" "c" "d" "e" "f" "g" "h" "i" "j" "k" "l" "m" "n" "o" "p" "q" "r" "s"
## [20] "t" "u" "v" "w" "x" "y" "z"

#Based on the above vector LETTERS:
#a. You need to produce a vector that contains the first 11 letters.
>first_11_letters <- LETTERS[1:11]
>first_11_letters
[1] "A" "B" "C" "D" "E" "F" "G" "H" "I" "J" "K"

#b. Produce a vector containing the odd-numbered letters.
>odd_letters <- LETTERS[seq(1, length(LETTERS), by = 2)]
>odd_letters
 [1] "A" "C" "E" "G" "I" "K" "M" "O" "Q" "S" "U" "W" "Y"
 
#c. Produce a vector that contains the vowels
>plot(1:10, my_vector, main = "Scatter Plot", xlab = "Index", ylab = "Value")

#d. Produce a vector that contains the last 5 lowercase letters.
>last_5_lowercase_letters <- letters[22:26]
> last_5_lowercase_letters
[1] "v" "w" "x" "y" "z"

#e. Produce a vector that contains letters between 15 to 24 in lowercase.
> letters_15_to_24 <- letters[15:24]
> letters_15_to_24
 [1] "o" "p" "q" "r" "s" "t" "u" "v" "w" "x"
 
#For task 2:
#a. Create a character vector for the cities: Tuguegarao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban, Samal Island, and Davao City, named "city."
> city <- c("Tuguegarao City", "Manila", "Iloilo City", "Tacloban", "Samal Island", "Davao City")
> city
[1] "Tuguegarao City" "Manila"          "Iloilo City" 
[4] "Tacloban"        "Samal Island"    "Davao City"

#b. Create a numeric vector for the average temperatures, named "temp."
> temp <- c(42, 39, 34, 34, 30, 27)
> temp
[1] 42 39 34 34 30 27

#c. Create a data frame to combine the "city" and "temp."
> weather_data <- data.frame(City = city, Temperature = temp)
> weather_data
             City Temperature
1 Tuguegarao City          42
2          Manila          39
3     Iloilo City          34

5    Samal Island          30
6      Davao City          27

#d. Rename the columns using the names() function.
> names(weather_data) <- c("City", "Temperature")
> weather_data
             City Temperature
1 Tuguegarao City          42
2          Manila          39
3     Iloilo City          34

5    Samal Island          30
6      Davao City          27

#e. Print the structure by using str() function. Describe the output.
> str(weather_data)
'data.frame':	6 obs. of  2 variables:
 $ City       : chr  "Tuguegarao City" "Manila" "Iloilo City" "Tacloban" ...
 $ Temperature: num  42 39 34 34 30 27

#f. From the answer in d, what is the content of row 3 and row 4 What is its R code and
its output?
> row_3_and_4 <- weather_data[3:4, ]
> row_3_and_4
         City Temperature
3 Iloilo City          34
4    Tacloban          34

#g. From the answer in d, display the city with highest temperature and the city with
the lowest temperature. What is its R code and its output?
> city_highest_temp <- weather_data[which.max(weather_data$Temperature), "City"]
> city_lowest_temp <- weather_data[which.min(weather_data$Temperature), "City"]
> cat("City with the highest temperature:", city_highest_temp, "\n")
City with the highest temperature: Tuguegarao City 
> cat("City with the lowest temperature:", city_lowest_temp, "\n")
City with the lowest temperature: Davao City
